This app will only continue to molder and degrade from neglect. Bugs never get fixed and essential updates are not made. I can hardly believe this app is still in the App Store, it makes Yahoo look so bad. \nUnfortunately, there are so many other messaging app options out there and Yahoo is a struggling company right now, so they probably see declining usage of Yahoo for chat and figure it isn't worth it to put money into. It didn't have to be this way -- companies can spur a return to a service if they update and innovate. They were able to do so with Flickr with the 1TB of space and redesign. Sadly, the Yahoo Messenger service is dying."},{"topic": "Update made it crap.", "rating": 1, "version": "Version 2.2.9", "user": "OneToughChick", "text": "Used to work perfect.

But as usual, even with their lame, late support for the Mac OS desktop versions, so too is the iOS version being neglected. \n\nThe iPhone 5 has been released a couple months now and all the major applications have been updated for the new screen- except Yahoo! Messenger. The video calling in this application is never smooth and has never improved in any of the newer versions. Imagine we are in 2012 on the brink of 2013 and a company like Yahoo!, one of the major players in the game, cannot get video calling right? Skype is not as old as Yahoo! and theirs works well. Tango is a newcomer that works great. Come on Yahoo! The push notification system for this is seriously faulty. There are times when if I do not launch the app, I don't get messages. But when I do launch it, sometimes 4 to 6 messages are there waiting on me. It's quite annoying for a person like myself that depends on the push notifications to inform me of incoming, important activity.\nThe only thing that works efficiently in this is the text part of the messaging. Sending photos is a hit and miss as you can barely tell if is works more than it doesn't. Most times, photos time out or they just fail. Sometimes it says sent on your device while the person who was supposed to receive it complains of not getting anything. But when it works, it works like it should.\n\nYahoo! needs to update this application. I am enduring it because I communicate with most of my contacts through this provider and if does not make sense using IMO and beejive because native features that Yahoo! users are accustomed to are not in other applications. \nGive the dial pad back for those that use it- I don't use it and honestly I don't miss it but there are other users complaining about it- BRING IT BACK.

So much about this is awful I wish all my friends would migrate to Skype or google simply so I could delete all of yahoo from all of my devices and computers.\n\n1. The biggest problem is best described in this quote from yahoo voice customer service:\n\nWe are sorry to inform you that the Yahoo! Voice services are no longer supported in Yahoo! Messenger for iOS devices. This is as of version 2.2.7 of Yahoo! Messenger for iOS devices, released last August 8, 2012. You may still continue on using your Phone Out or Phone In service in the Yahoo! Messenger client for Windows or Mac.\n\nBack in May, I bought a VoIP number and a load of credits specifically so that I could make calls from my iPad rather than carrying around my cell phone. Within 3 months they decide to change the app so that the whole reason I bought VoIP is now a joke and my mo EY spent now lost to their refund policy. \n\n2. The app constantly has issues. For one, the keyboard will get frozen on the screen so that I can't see the message I am typing. Second, IMs from people already in my contact list (for years) intermittently pop up asking I accept/reject their add request... Sometimes it does this in the middle of a conversation with that person.  I then end up with multiple windows of chatting to the same person, which eventually crashes my ipad. Third, it will display a new message icon but when I touch the banner it it brings me to a completely different conversation. Fourth, the  frame with the contact list will go completely black from time to time and only rebooting will fix it so I can see my contacts. Fifth, the swappable screens from conversation to conversation freeze halfway and stay stuck there until I reboot.\n\n3. Messages constantly get lost in cyberspace if I am logged on to more than one instance of IM. I, like others, have IM running on my desktop at start up and I like to have it running on my iPad as well for when I need to be away from my desk. About 30% of the time, messages to me and from me go nowhere when I am logged on that way for a period of time... So that my mom doesn't get the message I am waiting for her in the car and the one she sends to me asking where I am pops up only on my desktop. \n\n4.  The app constantly crashes so hard that I have to either totally reboot the iPad and/or uninstall and reinstall the app. \n\nIt is so clear that this app is a total piece of crap I find it ridiculous that Apple evens allows it in the iTunes store giving its its incredible instability in the native iOs environment. I find it amazingly bad business practice to offer a specific service and then take it away from a customer who paid upfront for a year's worth of service without offering a refund of some kind. I should have abandoned yahoo altogether after my email was hijacked for the umpteenth time... And again after IM decided to simply accept all add requests -despite having it set otherwise -  and wiped out my ignore list for no apparent reason other than a 'glitch' during an update. Shame on you Yahoo. \n\nIf you've got the IQ of a brick, you will stay away from this app. In fact, Skype, Oovoo, Meebo, whatever, are vastly superior. Hell, an old fashioned rotary dial telephone is superior to this piece of junk backed as it is by an uncaring company."},{"topic": "Crash...crash...burn!", "rating": 1, "version": "Version 2.2.7", "user": "Clrdo82", "text": "It's always crashing, signs me out all the time, and don't get messages!!

The texting would be fine one moment, and then all of a sudden neither party is receiving messages even though the UI of the sender shows the messages as being sent.  We would normally resort to $0.50 texts just to make sure the conversation hasn't ended for some questionable reason--which is precisely what telephone companies want.  We're now using \"Whatsapp\" which comes with a clever UI that incorporates an automated talk-back feature.  It uses one checkmark for a sent message, and a corresponding 2nd checkmark for the reception that message.  If there are unforeseen delays in the sent message, the single checkmark will detail this.  YM (and Skype) have no such feature, and are prone to these 1-4 hr texting delays.

Incoming calls don't work at all anymore.  My iPad rings, but annoyingly it doesn't use the iPad ringtone.  I do get a notification which I can hit to take me to the Yahoo app, but the app does not automatically switch to the phone tab, which is annoying because valuable time is being wasted delaying the opportunity to answer the call.  When I do answer the call, everything looks normal except that the caller cannot hear anything I say.  The volume is set correctly, the iPad is not muted, so I don't know why the caller cannot hear me.  I can hear the caller talk so I know the connection is established.  If I then return the call to the caller, the connection is fine.  I tried using the iPhone compatible earbuds with the inline mic, but that doesn't help.  Also, when this problem occurs...after I hang up in frustration, the recent calls list has no record of the call.

I have had to uninstall and reinstall many times a day. It is so frustrating and heart wrenching to not know if he will be able to contact me. I'm not sure if yahoo understands how important this messenger is to our US Military serving over seas and their family.

This happened to me a few times in the past, but when I resent the message, then  logged out and back in everything was ok including the message got sent twice. Today, when I resent another message that didn't go though I hit resend and it went through twice again, but this time when I later went to relog back in on my ipad it deleted %75 of both contacts I had important conversations with and I never hit the reset button ever. I needed these conversations for records and now they are almost all gone. So, I log off again and back on to see even more of the conversation deleted, but about %10 remained.. Its suppose to save the info to your ipad and instead it deleted it for no reason.. There are bugs and if you don't want your conversation deleted by bugs, then buyers beware and stay away from the yahoo ipad app!!! Its horrible! Why did my conversations mysteriously disappear.

The ability to scroll back through a conversation that's evolved over a period of days or weeks is very important to me. However, Yahoo! IM only retains a small portion of conversation for each contact. Beyond this set limit, the content is lost as more messages are exchanged. While I understand setting this as a default behavior, it seems a glaring omission in terms of options, especially since it's been a PC option for so long, and also since Yahoo! already provides cloud storage that could be used to store and access such history away from the iPhone it's run on--as well as to sync history with PC and Mac versions of the client.\n\nOutside of these two factors, the app is a fine one.

That app let's you know when the other person is typing, and when you send an IM it shows you when the message was received by the server and then by the receiver. Which is nice because that way you know that your message was received. I've sent IM with Yahoo that were never received and there was no way of\nme knowing. Sending and receiving photos is also better in that app.\n\nEven though that app has a lot of great features that beat Yahoo's, it has some connectivity issues. Something that I hardly experience with Yahoo Messenger. That's the only reason why Yahoo Messenger beats it.\n\nI really wish that the people at Yahoo would take the time to download WhatsApp. I think that they might be surprise about how nice that app is.

Then today it started slow with about 1 out of 2-3 msgs saying \"failure\" & asking if I wanted to resend. Then got continually worse till even the ones I resent like 4-5 times STILL weren't going thru & I stopped getting msgs from those I was chatting with! Then it signed me out for no apparent reason & had to sign back in... but why bother when it doesn't work! Also no vid chat w/iphone 4! In fact it doesnt work well with iphpne 4 at all! Please fix this cuz right now I give it no stars.\n\nupdate: \nok so after reporting this problem, the \"failure to deliver\" msgs seemed to stop, BUT now it seems to take anywhere between 1-6 HOURS to get a message. This isn't INSTANT! \n\nThis app is driving me nuts & I'm gonna just quit using it till they figure out how to make this app work. Doesn't even do basic chat IM's with iphone 4! And no vid, pics aren't working either. This app is all buggy, and often I have ofund that right after loggin out, out of frustration, then loggin back in, all of the sudden I have several messages waiting. Sometimes I'm not even getting push notifications even tho I have it enabled in settings. \n\nBut when a msg comes in hours later on a chat, the time & date stamp ALWAYS says it was sent hours earlier (ie: get a msg at 11:49p, but no push, so had to find on own, AND date/time stamp say this msg was sent at 6:10p hrs earlier). So why is this happening? What the heck is taking this app 5-6 hrs to deliver a short msg to someone in town? My chat buddy isn't even that far away, so it's not like this IM has to travel across the world or something. Maybe having diff carriers & diff apps for yahoo IM messenger is causing this? Does it really take that long to find their service provider, phone, & which app for yahoo IM they're using? Hard to believe but it's all I can come up with, or else my only other rationale is that this app just blows!\n\nIt should never take 6 HOURS for an IM to come in, nor should I have to log out & back in every 5 secs to get a msg! PLEASE FIX THIS APP! It seems to work for my chat buddy on their blackberry, so it must be this iphone version on my end! There's no reason for this, if I was on my pc it would go thru almost instantly. I don't mean to sound harsh, but this app has some serious problems... and not just 1! NEEDS UPDATING BADLY!!!! I give it zero stars still... even later. My friend gets the msgs I send in minutes or sooner, & has confirmed this, but I am not getting theirs till sometimes even the next day. Makes carrying on a decent convo very tough and pretty worthless, considering eBuddy app )that does Yahoo IM, fb, twiiter, & others works waaay better! I'm switching to this app from now on. Lemme know if this app gets improved, then maybe I'll try it again. I mean it's free, but still. If the idea is to make it glitchy on purpose so ppl use & pay for more texts, then this is not the app for me.

Another problem is sometimes when I'm not on the app and I get a badge that says there is a message, I go on to check my message but then I don't get anything, I have to close the app and then go back on and wait a minute for it to finally show up. Also it would be really awesome if there was a way to save conversations, like if you could save the conversation to your email that would be really cool, oh and in other IM apps you can copy messages just like if you were texting, if you hold down on the message you'll get an option to copy, that would be nice if I could do that on this messenger.

It can do everything the computer versions can do but on your iPod. And when I mean everything I'm serious. This app even let's you do video calls! I personally think it's better than the skype, windows live, and aim apps just because of that. Before I got this app I could only FaceTime with two other people I knew that had the iPod 4th gen/iPhone. Now I can FaceTime with the 20 plus people I know that have yahoo accounts and webcams. This is basically the only app I have seen so far that can video chat with people using computers. So basically if your friend has a computer and a webcam you can now chat with him/her using your iPod. And if they don't have a yahoo account or yahoo messenger it only takes a few steps to sign up for an account or install yahoo messenger on their computer. So what I'm saying is that if you want to be able to FaceTime with people on their computers and not just on their iPhones/iPods you should get this app. It is like the other instant messaging apps except for in my opinion 10 times better just because of the video chat option on the iPod/ iPhone. So until the other instant messaging services (skype, windows live, and aim) get the video chat feature for the iPod and iPhone I'm sticking with yahoo."},{"topic": "Love(d) it....", "rating": 1, "version": "Version 2.0.1", "user": "LucKy K22", "text": "Till it stopped working.

Before, I always got the push notification right then and there when the message was sent, but now the notifications are sent 20 minutes late!

Also, sometimes when you are SMS messaging, when I go into landscape mode the SMS letter count stays at 140. Another suggestion: get SMS photo messaging!

I have reset the app and deleted it but nothing helps. PLEASE fix this. I rely on this app very heavily and normally it is fabulous.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nOLD REVIEW\u2014\n\n  I am absolutely THRILLED that Yahoo got the update with push back out as quickly as they did. It works BEAUTIFULLY. The alerts you get when msgs are pushed to you are nice and loud. I just wish they were that loud when the app is open and you get a new MSG.  I love how the app transitions when you flip it to landscape and back. EXCEPT with the new update when I go from landscape to regular part of the MSG is missing.  I am also glad to have the buzz feature but HATE the 30second limit before you can use it again especially when you want to buzz another contact.  Also, my picture doesn't show anymore. It disappeared after the update before last. Also most of the time I have the app open and my phone goes into the sleep mode or locks itself the app loses the wifi connection at my house.

I love being able to chat as much as we want without worrying about text limits. Push works well.i used to get previews through push that wouldn't show in the conversation once it was opened. That hasn't happened lately so that mightve been fixed with the last update. I dont know anyone else who had that problem.  I wish the time would show the actual time tgey sent the message rather than tge time i opened the app.  :-(  Great interface. Only a few problems. It doesn't display someones status in blue like the screenshot shows. I have settings to not use landscaping, which I like. But sometimes I end up with only half a screen showing. So the left side of the conversation doesn't show. I have to back out then go back in which really takes way too long to load.  It seems like this happens with movement.

It would be nice to be able to choose which tone you want to hear when getting a message. Another new issue is when using messenger in landscape mode if i turn back to portrait mode and there is a long message, it gets cut off and the only way to read it is to go back to landscape. So now there are new issues plus the issues I've listed in an earlier review. I gave it 3 stars before but the issues are still not fixed so now it's 2 stars. Hopefully user issues will be resolved soon. \nFirst review:\nI use this app everyday all day. It's a good app. I love the fact that I can use it on 3g and not just wifi. I don't like that  you can't copy and paste conversations from messenger. Instead you have to get an old fashion pen and paper. Also when I get a message and don't read it right away, when I finally do read it the time stamp says the time you read it, not the time it was sent. Those things need to be fixed.

Sumtimes it will make a little sound like when I send a message as an alert. But my screen won't light up with the message being displayed. Needs new update again to fix this problem. I gave 4 stars kuz it works perfect. I just want my push notifications to work again!!! Oh and it needs the contact picture update too so we all who have this app can change and add profile pix.
