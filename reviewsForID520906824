Lep's world 2 is awesome!
This is by far my favorite game. My children and I love Lep, and competition. And this is a great game to compete against each other right to the end and I must say that I am still the champion just as I was with Lep's world 1. I was 1st to make it all the way to the finish in 1 and 2 which the last level in Lep's world 2 was a challenge, but I rose to the challenge and WON, I won't tell you what I won as that would ruin your surprise for when you get there, but let me tell you this it  is extremely hard as my boy's and I found out. So play, don't be scared or are you chicken?  No I know your not chicken you are brave so go on help Lep save his village you won't be sorry this game is an action packed adventure right to the last level, you will never be bored with this game you'll want more like we do and hopefully, when you make it through your journey Lep's world 3 is released however, if it isn't you can go back and play Lep's world 2 again and again like we do trying to do better than we first did with the knowledge we gained going through the first time. Lep is incredibly fun and worth every hour you will spend on it. You didn't think it would be fast did, no no no and believe me you won't be wanting it to be once you begin playing you will understand my last statement. We finished both of their games in July 2013, and we have been patiently awaiting Lep's world 3 to be released so we can get our game faces on again. My boy's are eager to try and defeat me at Lep's 3 however, what they don't know is I'll never let that happen because I play while they are at school and I control their IPAD usage so they don't get to play Unless their homework is completed which it is usually their bedtime by the time all the fussing is done. Lol.  So if you haven't played a Lep's game before START NOW! YOU MUST, you won't be sorry, in fact if you have played like we have you will be sending emails and comments to the makers of the game begging them to release Lep's World 3 like we do... Which I hear it's scheduled to come out the end of this month. October 2013! This review I am writing under is Lep's world 2 so obviously there is one before this so you can play them both in fact you can play them together if you wanted to and believe me you will want too that's how AWESOME the games are. Lep's world RULES! So stop reading any other reviews 5 and get playing. Lep and his people are in need of you, please hurry! Good Luck.

Reminds me of a watered down version of Super Mario Bros. Smooth gameplay, so far I have not experienced any crashes. Music could be better as well as adding boss characters, came across a Bowser inspired level and there was no boss. Overall the game is pretty easy and is the closest game your going to get to Super Mario Bros on IOS.

Not bad
Maybe if there were more options such as "crouching" and more challenging levels then I might of rate this game an "four" otherwise can't complain of not paying for what it's worth. Oh and the ads gets in the way of things so if I had to pay, then it would of still gave it a "three" instead of a "four".

5 star game with 3 star items
It is a very fun game but I hate that the ads open themselves in the middle of a game! I'd rather have it be at the end if any. At the end though, the ad pops up and if you don't click "done" right away it goes to the add app or ad page and tries to get you to purchase what ever it is. That is not fun. Some parts in certain  worlds will have an almost impossible task for you to complete. It takes up most of your time allotted to you trying to over come the obstacle.  That is not fun either. Please fix! Other than that fun game. :)

Annoying banner ads
After you die or complete the level, a banner ad shows up on the bottom of the screen. The trouble is, if you had been hitting the right arrow to go through the exit you will almost always click it. It is so aggravating!

This game is a really well-executed 2d scroller but I am seriously considering deleting it because of the ads.

Don't Wast You Time! :(
At first I loved the game in the beginning. Later on, I thought is was a total wast of time! I would play and it would start me back to the beginning so many times! It would also start you back in the beginning if all your lives were gone, and you might be so far in the game. I would totally recommend a different game if I were you. I wish there was a Mario game because I know it would be better than this game! I'm so disappointed! 😡😣😢😖😠😡

Ads WAY TO INTRUSIVE
Just about useless to play at moment, ads keep getting in ways and playing one level managed to open ad to download freaking stupid candy crush saga about 8 times. Not only do I have no desire to ever play that game, having it shoved down my throat on every website I go to and all social networks as well, now I have it forced o. Me in games I actually want to play. Well wanted, wont be playing til they fix this this- this is awful and impossible to at like this. I get you need to make money, but you won't make any if no I e can play because if ads.

Good but multiplayer not so good
I enjoy playing this game but when I try playing multiplayer if the other person dies then it tells me that they quit?!? Not sure why but I'm stuck having to find them again. That's my only complaint. Also another problem I'm noticing is that m on world 8 now and sometimes the controls will go wacky on me. Ill go to jump and it won't let me or it starts going backwards when I'm pressing the forward arrows. Making me die a lot. I've had to start world 8over a few times now :/ love the game. Fix this glitch please. <3

Fantastic Mario bros copycat
How has noone done this before? This is almost exactly the same as Mario, which is why it's almost the perfect game. No running fast (sonic), no smashing things with your head (bonks adventure for turbo graphix 16 if you are old enough to remember) and no stupid crash bandicoot. Just pure bliss of jumping around gathering gold coins and jumping on topi of bad guys to kill them and shooting fireballs. Thanks for making this game. And sorry for calling it a copycat. Highly recommended.

Kind of cool but problematic.
Compared to the first Lep this is basically the same but easier and they took out the best enemy. The took a few elements from super Mario 3, but unfortunately not the good ones. While you can pick different worlds and levels they are basically all the same. 

One of the most frustrating things is they added a vertical element to the game but is virtually unused until the last level. The wall slide is also cool but useless until the last level, in fact this "ability" caused me to die far more than anything else because Lep would accidentally wall jump when I didn't want to. 

Having bosses is cool but they are basically all the same. Once you figure it out they are easy to beat provided you don't wall jump when you mean to just grab a pine cone.

Simple, yet Enjoyable
Gameplay: The gameplay is nearly identical to Mario's early endeavors with one hook: you have the ability to throw a projectile, albeit with limited ammunition. The level design is solid, if slightly repetitive. Boss fights also tend to be on the easy side, but are adequate.

Graphics and Sound: Wonderfully done. Simple and colorful, the graphics work elegantly for a platformer and the sounds, though simple, get the job done with ease.

Replayability: This is where the game falls short. After the "campaign", there is much, if anything left to do, unless you enjoy replaying levels.
---------------------------------------------Overall: Leps World 2 Plus is a worthy addition to your IOS library, particularly of you are in the market for a platformer. Don't expect it to blow your mind, but this title definitely succeeds where it counts.

Love it!!! But there's a problem...
I love it but there's a bug. I can't get past level 1-3. I complete it & then it tanks when I hit the next button to take me to level 1-4. I paid for this so I think I should get my money's worth right?

I LOVE THIS GAME! But when I finish a SUPER HARD LEVEL the game goes off and takes me to my home screen. I press it again and it makes me redo the HARD LEVEL! If the game didn't do that it would be the best game EVER! ( I LOVE that it doesn't require WIFI! )

Infuriatingly Sloppy Controls
I'm astonished about all these 5-star reviews that compare this game to Super Mario. It is only similar in look.

It has none of the precision gameplay that made Mario Great. In fact, the controls are the sloppiest I've ever used, especially for a platformer. The character slides around haphazardly. All of the challenge in the game comes from trying to get the character to move the way you want him to. Pitiful and infuriating.

I wish I hadn't bothered.

Agrees with Disappointed. But love it
I love this game and hopes that Lep 3 comes out. But Level8-8 is hard! Unless you have some way to beat this level. I cannot pass it. Unless I am doing something wrong. But I try to play it and still cannot get pass that wizard!

Dissatisfied
I really like the game however level 8-8 is so hard you can't pass it. I have tried so many times it isn't fun anymore. You can't beat the wizard. And when you die.... (Because they make it impossible by taking away all the cones you save up) you have to go back to the beginning of the world I stead of just the level. I have enjoyed playing but don't think I will play anymore sadly since I have been trying for days to beat an impossible level. I agree the game should be a challenge, but not impossible.

Difficult But Great Game!
I just killed the last Boss in Level 8, and the game ended.  This was a difficult game, but it kept my interest.  The graphics were top-notch, and the soundtrack was great.  Sometimes the controls weren't responsive but this was very rarely.  I liked the idea of each of the eight worlds having a Boss at the end.  Cool!

Can't wait for Lep's World 3!

The question I think is...
So you download Leps  wld 2, defeat the first boss,  lose your progress, have to download Leps wld 2 plus, play through those levels again, then pay to unlock the rest? Loox like you can't even unlock them til you get past the first boss again. Why not have just one version where you can buy the rest if the levels without all the hassle? Also, it should be just 1 or 2$, not 3$. The game itself would rate 4-5 stars if something would be done about the above issues...devs please consider...

Edit- this version so far is letting me play further than the other version. Now four stars.

This game is pretty cool!
I like this game! But, I think Super Mario Bros. is better than this. To improve this make more power ups like wings for flying or rainbow power that makes you invincible or better yet a giant four leaf clover that makes you huge! Also, I think there should be a shop that you can access after levels or on the menu so you can buy stuff with the coins you earn from levels like extra lives and other stuff. That would make it awesome!

Awesome game!!
I love this game it's so addicting!!! But I think it's getting a bug because when I play it won't let me hit some of the blocks I just go right through them. Other times I will fall off randomly and be killed. I was just playing and there was no place where you could have died but when I climbed the hill I fell through and died! Please fix it so I can keep playing it! Other wise awesome game love it!!!

Closest thing to a Mario game I've seen in IOS excellent!
Love the Theme of the entire game. Things are peaceful...bad guy comes and brings certain doom upon the hero. Hero on a quest to save the day...love it my perfect game! Love the lush graphics, the enjoyable music, the Mario like levels but, yet it holds enough on its own to be original due to collecting pine cones instead of power ups and if you touch another enemy wrong its not game over unless your out of four leaf clovers. Great game!

It's really fun,but after a few levels it starts to glitch, I don't right reviews often but I suppose I should on this certain game. Though its fun, I don't see the difference in the leps world 2 plus and leps world 2! But overall I think it's fun! And I will continue to use it! Thank you for making a second one!!!! You deserve this rate!!! ( in a good way) thank you!

Loved it, but was a Mario clone
The one thing the iPhone is missing is a Super Mario game, this game is an extremely enjoyable Mario clone but I think the developers wanted it like that, they were probably aware of the need for a Mario iPhone game as well, overall they could have been more original but it's a good game 👍

Terrible. Always crashing
This game is fun when you can PLAY the levels. I finished 1-1 right away and 1-2 then it crashed two times in a row. I eventually got on 1-3 but whenever I finish it with All of the pots of gold it crashes and goes to the home screen. I hate it you can't even get on the 4th level. I would not recommend this for anyone. I give it 0 stars but I have to rate it. So 1 but just know its really 0.

My review.
Alright, so this is a great improvement from the first game from what I've seen of both so far. 

The controls are responsive and work great when I meed to do rapid direction changes. 

The graphics are made well for what this game is and what its platform happens to be.

 The pinecones are nice, as they well should be. I still find it hilarious that these things have the destructive power of a hand grenade. 

My only complaint? You can't throw the damned snail shells.

Crasher
This game always crashes when i try to play it . When it finally decides to act right,  i get to defeat the boss then it crashes again and i have to start the level over .  Sometimes i cant even play  it because it crashes before i even start a level . It will say "loading" then crash . This crashing thing got so annoying to the point where i dont even play the game anymore.

Decent game for being free.
This game lived up to its title, free. But thats just about it. It was really simple and straight forward. For me, it was far, far too easy. The boss fights were blah, because they were all the same. Jump, pine cone in the back. Rinse and repeat. Even the final fight with the wizard was a joke lol. Levels began to become far too repetitive, and too short. Like I said, this game lived up to being free, but if you want to put it in the market for dollar bills, you better step your game up. Because this game sure aint worth a dollar at the least. Also, the left and right controls began to fail sometimes during the game. Thats a real bugger.

But when I try to move on to the next level the game crashes and when I reopen the app I'd have to repeat the previous level again, even though I've already completed it.

Pretty good game
This app plays and feels just like an old school Super Mario game but with the difference of being a leprechaun roaming around a leprechaun/Super Mario environment. Now, I'm not sure if this part of the gameplay is different when you purchase the actual game but the only gripe I have is that I wish there were boss battles at the end of the final stages. Other than that, this is a pretty cool game worth checking out.

STEPS BACKWARD
I am not a gamer, but I had a ton of fun playing Lep's world. after I beat the whole game, I was super excited to get Lep's world 2 PLUS for free. then I started playing it, it was HORRIFYING. Lep moves in a very jerky way, and the graphics are just confusing. in the first Lep's world, Lep just glided along, but in this, he acts like he's on a hangover or something!! so disappointed.

Great Game
This game reminds me of old school Mario Bros! I've bought the first one & got this one for free. I gave it 4 stars for one reason. When you finish a level you need to immediately lift your fingers off the screen. Ads pop up where the directional buttons were just at. Sneaky way to get you to check out that ad, which I don't. If the ads were moved I would give 5 stars.

Well, to start with the movement controls aren't that great, I find myself accidentally moving in the wrong direction. Also, why in the world is water instant death?! Makes no sense. But on the plus side Lep's world 2 is free with 64 levels, and they are better. I am slightly disappointed with the first game, but that's probably why they made a sequel ;)

Terrible Game
First of all i thought that this game was fun... But then i spoke to soon! Usually i loose all of my lives because the controls dont work and the animals touch me and i die!!!😡 I was just playing the game and i an on the last world so i was jumping and i know that i was clicking the right control button to jump, so i jump and then it felt as if there was a roof over the elf and i lost all of my lives because of that spot.... I got so mad i bit into my new iPhone 5 and now there is a dent on it! I feel like suing your company!!!!

More original
Good job! I'm glad you replaced the really annoying music and made it a little less Mario-like. Though I do miss the snail shells being kickable, like in the original Super Jump World. You should also add full motion video cutscenes, the comic-book style is a bit overused.

NEEDS TO BE FIXED!!!!!
This is a pretty cool game and it reminds me of Mario bros, BUT it is VERY laggie and it crashes ALL THE TIME. Esspecially in world 8-7. You need to play that world literally about 8 to 10 times before it will FINALLY let you play 8-8. It is VERY frustrating. I can't wait to beat the last world. I may not play again for a while after that a least until the game gets fixed.

It's a great game and I love it. But I think that you need to space the move buttons further apart. When ever I try to go forward sometimes it sends me backwards. And it's not only me that this happens to. Some of my friends said the same thing. But overall a great game.

Glitches need to be addressed
I am a hug fan of this game, but I am getting very frustrated at the glitches in this game. When playing multiplayer, the other person seemed to be lagging and then all of a sudden would burst ahead. Also, the buttons at the bottom have not shown up several times while playing this game, leaving me to figure out where to put my fingers for the controls. Also, I have been kicked out of the same level 4 times after completing it and it will close and go to the home screen. When I go back, it acts like I never completed that level. If these updates would be fixed, I would give it 5 stars since I am addicted to the game.

Could've Been Great - (only for free version)
For me, this game seems to fall short (granted I only played the free version), but I just wish for more. It is an obvious knock-off of Mario; a side scrolling platformer, but regardless, I still enjoyed it. The environment didn't really fit together, there was no progression - and just out of curiosity, why is the Leprechaun throwing pine cones, of all things?? Maybe there is some lore that I am missing? They still could have gone with something better, I mean for gods-sakes, the main character is a magical, mythical leprechaun, there could be so much potential when it comes to the creation of the enemies, the environment, and the "weaponry". But so far this is the best substitute for a Mario-like game that I have found for an app (at least that is free), so I guess I'll have to settle. The levels were also very simplistic and easy, which created a casual feel along with a sometimes almost monotonous and boring gameplay. Bottom line, it was fun enough to begin with that I finished the free version, but I just want more out the game. I mean, it could be my fault for raising my expectations, but I just seem so much potential for what the game could be; even though it is a Mario "knock-off".

This is a fantastic platforming game squarely in the tradition of Mario. Beautiful art, fun characters and great if maddening game play! Exactly as a platformer should be. Slightly sluggish controls but can be compensated for with practice.

Pedestrian clone of Super Mario
This game gave me new appreciation for how talented the folks at Nintendo are. The makers managed to copy a lot of elements of the classic Mario sidescroller, but in the process stripped out all the attention to detail, polish, game design and fun that those games have in spades.

I really like this game, I was happy when a second level came out. I'm addicted to this game, it's definitely a time killer. I'm stuck on a level that crashes, I paid for a game -- hoping I had no problem with going further in the levels. Fix this please!

FIX CRASHING ON IOS 5
I really like this game and i cant play it because i am jailbroken so i cant upgrade to ios 6. It would really help if u could help fix the crashing. I can only play if i reboot my ipod and after i play 1 level and try to move on to the next, it crashes and even tho i finished the level  before the crash, when i come back the next 1 is still locked. I only got to play 3 levels and now im like "stuck" on the 3rd cuz of the crashing. Plz fix the crash and ill rate this game 5 stars.

Best Platformer
When the original Lep's world came out, people seemed to dismiss it as a Mario rip off. Well, I enjoyed the original anyway, but the sequel stands on its own as a polished, and challenging platformer with its own identity. Easily the best platformer I've played on iOS, and I've played many. It's a long game with different themed worlds and a wide array of enemies. It definitely has strong replay value... This is money well spent, I hope to see a Leps World 3.

Add combo scores
Love the game, should add score multiplier when you jump on multiple enemies without stopping. Like when you have 2 snails together I'll jump on both an get the shells also before I land on the ground but the score is always 150 an would be more rewarding to jump on multiple enemies non stop an see the score increase.

Great game, but
It is almost impossible to play. The latest update was supposed to fix the issues with the controls but they are now worse than before. There are only 4 buttons, so it shouldn't be that hard to map the buttons so when you hit right, you go right, not left. And it's not from fat fingering it either. I look down to see what button I am pressing and it is showing that I am hitting the correct button. Now the game has started crashing in mid game.

I can't even get into it anymore.... The update made it worse for me. I have the 4th generation iPod touch. I love the game a lot but it would be nice if I could      Actually play the game...... So two stars I am going to uninstall it to see if that works.

This game is pretty fun, good thing to do during some down time. Pretty much just like Mario but I like Mario so that's not a bad thing. The only glitch I've experienced so far is that my left arrow button doesn't always work right away but it's not gotten me killed yet so I'm not too mad about it, it's just annoying sometimes. Otherwise works fine. I'd say this app is worth a buck for sure.

Still Crashes @ 6-8
Addendum Oct 20: Even with update, still crashes half way through 6-8. If this is resolved I will increase stars. 
 
This is a fun simple game with good graphics and sound. Harkens back to Mario which I love. Worth four stars for sure if it didn't crash every time I get half way through 6-8. I'm on IPhone 4. I'd give it 5 stars if enemies got progressively harder to kill and each boss was different rather than just an adjustment of the first. Definitely a game worth having in your repertoire when bug is fixed.

Really fun but....
It seems like the buttons don't work sometimes.   Even when I'm not in danger of losing, I hit the arrows or jump and nothing happens.  At first I thought it was just me with sweaty fingers or something but nope, I played with dry cold hands and got the same result. Hopefully it can be fixed but otherwise it's a great game.

Platform FTW
We loved the first Lep's and #2 is even better! This game is polished and should be a favorite like angry birds, cut the rope, and plants v. zombies!!!

At this point Nintendo will likely not branch out, and this game gives me a great Mario fix like I've not had in a while!

Not bad
Better than the first one. This game really has the potential to be great. Make it more like Mario 3 with a map that shows the worlds/levels and be able to go down tree trunks and a little bit more variety levels with secret areas. It's too easy, no in game sound track. 

I'm waiting for someone to put the big boy pants on and make the MUST HAVE 2D Mario like game like how modern Combat owns the FPS market on iOS.

Lep's World 2
I really like the game! Normally afflicting games like these are fun for a couple days and then they get boring, but this is really fun. But when I get to the last stage of level six I get half way through the game before the app closes out on me. It just exits to the home screen at the exact same place in the game every time. And sometimes he doesn't jump for move when you press the buttons

Best version of super Mario for your phone. But it crashes after every boss battle. So hit the menu button after u beat a boss not the arrow. Plus there needs to b a shop. To upgrade armor and buy new abilities. Make the abilities cost a number of gold pots u normaly have to get in a level 💰
Stuff to put in shop. 
• acorns do twice the damage 
• shoot three acorns at once 
• triple jump
• and customize lep outfit

Awesome game!!
This game really is a lot like Super Mario Bros!  And just as much fun. I think this is more fun than the first Lep game. And maybe it is me but I think the controls are easier to use on this one. Get this game!!  Totally with the buck!!! Go for the gold!! Lol

this game really does play like Mario so it was fun and a good way to help pass the time if you're waiting around or just bored. the controls didn't respond sometimes so I ended up dying sooner than I should of but still finished the game and its really cool!

Leps world 2
I think leps world 2 is good but the only thing I didn't like is that after I finished the 1st world and the boss it didn't let me move on it made me start over.

better than first
this game definately exceeds the first one in all aspects. it has more levels, more platforming, more enemies, better game physics and bosses at the end of every world. of course lets not forget the cool power ups as well. i hope in the next game that they keep the platforming elements (maybe add more) and add secrets just like in mario. also, it would be great if they added more challenging enemies and give them each distinct abilities. one problem i have with the game is sometimes the controls would get stuck and lep would just sit there, i noticed it happens allot during boss fights so if that can be fixed i would appreciate it. i look forward for more games like this to be made. 

thank you devs for giving us this great gem of a game, please keep up the good work.

Leps world one was so awesome but I don't know how much better leps world 2 is because it freezes and goes back to home screen whenever I try to play the first level. I'm not mad because I know how fast this company can update it hopefully because I trust this company just by playing leps world 1. You update things fast I've seen It happen. But please fix bug. 🙏

At least 10x better than the first, but buggy
This game is awesome. If you love the first Lep's World or love Mario like games, you will love this game. It is at least 10x times better designed and better looking than the first.

However, it crashes quite frequently on the iPod Touch 4G. It crashes at the end of levels making me play the level over, it crashes when my device says its at 20%, and it crashes at random times thoughout the levels. I hope these are fixed in the next patch.

However, even with that said, it is still absolutely worth buying as it is extremely addicting and even better than the first, which was amazing.

Lep's World 2
More detailed than the first, the bosses at the end are fun, awesome that he can actually touch water without dying now lol. But the only bad thing is the right and left button doesn't work sometimes. Especially when a bad guy is coming at u...and Lep just freezes! Needs some work please!!!! Other than that....the game is very fun and thank you for finally updating it :)
