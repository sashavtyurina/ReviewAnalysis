I click \"No\", and another identical popup comes up.  This popup appears three times in a row and then it's gone until I minimize and reopen the app again.\n\nI like the interface, but I would like to see more options from the \"Contacts\" screen.  If I choose a contact to call, I simply get four options- \"Chat\", \"Email\", \"Voice\", and \"Video\".  This is fine, except that it does not account for multiple phone numbers per contact.  If I choose \"Voice\", it doesn't give me a choice of which method to call them (i.e. home phone, cell phone, work phone, etc.).  \n\nTo work around this, I can go to the \"Keypad\" screen and select the \"Contacts\" icon.  Then I'm allowed to choose which phone number to call for a particular contact.  I think this is great, but I'd like to have this option on the Contacts screen itself.\n\nI would also like to be able to maintain a separate VTok contacts list.  Currently, it simply pulls all the contacts that your iPad is aware of.  This might be fine for some users, but I'd like to have a separate list.\n\nAnother minor issue.  I don't feel that VTok needs to stop my music from playing when I'm text chatting with someone.

We both installed this app on our phones (iPhone 4) & just a few minutes ago, we were able to see & hear each other for the 1st time in weeks! Granted, the call quality was less than ideal & my camera froze up so it was basically just a picture of me the whole time, but he had a weak WiFi connection, so I'm sure it would've been better if he'd had a stronger signal. It's so ridiculously expensive to call Kuwait from the US & vice versa, so getting to talk for FREE & being able to actually see each other, too, is really incredible! Thank you SOOO much!

Firstly, the app is a major drain on the battery -- up to 5% every 10-15 minutes even when it's running in the background! I would like to be able to keep vtok open always so that people can contact me through gchat, but because of the significant battery drain, I cannot use this app for that purpose. Secondly, the application will randomly stop transmitting any chats, without either chat party being made aware of it -- I will only realize later that it was not that the other person stopped responding, it was that the chats were not going through, even though Internet connection has remained consistent. Thirdly, there is no way to modify or delete contacts (even those who have been hidden / deleted from gchat itself), and no way to view the full status / info of a contact -- this is implemented in a ll other chat apps. Finally, there are sometimes multiple entries shown for a single contact, each of which have different icons; I'm not sure what the cause of that is.\n\nThis is still a good gchat app, but these few problems are hindering it from becoming a great gchat app."},{"topic": "Video doesn't work!", "rating": 1, "version": "Version 2.5", "user": "AquaGMom10", "text": "Finally got video but no sound.
