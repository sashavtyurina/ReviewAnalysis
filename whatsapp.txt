Then it was bought by Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook. Then it (ie. WhatsApp) started totally unnecessary, unneeded, and unwanted features [and changes].\n\nFirst it was the \"Privacy\" setting (with \"Everyone\", \"My Contacts\", & \"Nobody\" as the options), when before that the only people that saw that you had WhatsApp (and likewise, that YOU saw that had WhatsApp) were the people in your phone's \"address-book\" (which is what populates your WhatsApp contact-list).\n\nThen it was the \"Instant access to photo-Camera\" camera-icon in the text-box where you type what you're going to say to the person whom you're chatting with. Like if people are too lazy to click the upward-pointing arrow and click the \"take photo or video\" option. Riiiiiight.\n\nMost recently is that darn phone-icon next to the profile picture of the person whom you're chatting with on WhatsApp. Which is to \"provide \"easier\" access to phone-calling people by phone\". Again: Like if people are too lazy to (in this case) click the person's name in the WhatsApp conversation (it's left of their profile picture), and then scroll down until you see the person-you're-chatting-with's phone-number, and then you tap that phone-number (or the \"phone\"-icon to the right of it) to phone-call that person. Riiiiiight.\n\nEnough is Enough. \n\n(Also: Please note that Facebook wanted your phone-number. And like me, tons of other people refused to give it to them. Now they're finding some other way to get it: By buying a communication program that [already] HAS your cellphone number.\n\nI did some digging and apparently the \"Everyone\", \"My Contacts\", & \"Nobody\" prescribes to-whom you are visible to on WhatsApp. \"Everyone\" apparently is \"everyone that uses WhatsApp\". \"My contacts\" is self-explanatory: Just your cellphone contacts. \"Nobody\" I guess is \"nobody on the Internet\" will see you.

It is easy for the app to bloat to gigabytes of data with all the media messages.  The authors need to think of clever ways to manage non-text messages. \nOther than that, the app had brought my family who is scattered over the globe together in some amazing ways. We have dedicated groups for the babies in the family, groups for the men in the family, groups for the women, and groups for whomever in your contacts. \nThe app is more private than facebook in the sense the groups are private and the chats are private. \nYou can manage your notifications for group messages differently from individual ones. I mute all group notifications and check them only when I want to. I have individual notifications turned on so I know a message is sent to me specifically. You can also have all sent media saved to your camera roll or you can turn that feature off. Now you know when a message was sent, when delivered, when opened. You can also know when the other user has last been in the app if they had enabled that feature. This is the one app I find myself using the most and the one that has most positive impact on my family relationships. Great app. But, again, authors need to improve media handling."},{"topic": "Cain", "rating": 5, "version": "Version 2.11.14", "user": "Cain0701", "text": "Para mi es de las aplicaciones top 5 de la historia de Apple"},{"topic": "Love this app", "rating": 5, "version": "Version 2.11.14", "user": "Saipan bojo", "text": "I can send a lot pics and video to my love one around the world"},{"topic": "Video llamada", "rating": 1, "version": "Version 2.11.14", "user": "Gotitherion", "text": "Falta mucho para ser una aplicaci\u00f3n perfecta"},{"topic": "Long - long distance messaging", "rating": 5, "version": "Version 2.11.14", "user": "Annieykc11", "text": "My daughter moved back to Sydney two years ago, and we can message each other without fear of HUMUNGOUS bills.

Then I come across a witty comment which I want to comment on, but I can't; it wouldn't make sense; for it was sent days ago. So I was wondering if you could change that, or maybe have it just for pictures.\nOtherwise, guys, this app is not bad at all.

I use whatsapp every day but it is more and more getting on my nerves. Another star goes down. \n\n[update 9-oct-2024] many times images and even simple text don't get sent and I have to retry many times. It's getting really\nCumbersome. I have to downgrade another star to Two until fixed. \n[update 4-oct-2014] Had to update for iOS 8 as it was crashing. Some people complain about the camera icon but for me there are two major issues: one, messages take much longer to send. Previously I got te first check mark right after sending the message and then the second. Now I get the clock icon (watch?) for up to 10-20 seconds sometimes before the first check mark and sometimes not even that and they timeout. The second problem is that they increased the size of text on the chat. While I am sure this works great for iPhone 6, on older iPhones I wish it was smaller like before. Easily fixable with a setting for text size. I love whatsapp but take two stars until solved. \n\nFrom Feb. 1 to Feb 13 I received 55 chat messages to update my whatsapp, which I never do. Then it stopped cold, no more update messages, and 6 days later it is announced that FB is buying Whatsapp for 19 Billion USD.  It looks like they were doing the valuation of the company and only recent versions of whatsapp have to pay a yearly fee. They were pushing hard for that number to be the largest so the valuation would be the highest. And it seems they succeeded. Not sure I like FB taking over whatsapp. Let's see, but other secure messaging apps  are growing and it is not US (NSA).

I have the new iPhone 6 and this app hasn't adjusted to the new screen size. Still stretched out and fuzzy. Come on guys. Get with it. (3) Setting your friends' profile pics is buggy. Some of my friends pics are ones that they've set, other times it's the pic I've set for them in my phone book. Would just like this to be consistent (and I'd like to be able to set any pic I want for my friends). I'd also like to be able to set the name of my contact for incoming notifications. My Dad is \"Dad\" within the app, but when I get a WhatsApp message from him it displays his full formal name (that he sets). Dislike this as well. (4) Be able to tap the mic button once to record, again to stop. Holding the button down for the entire message is silly and gives me all kinds of hand crampiness. \n\nOtherwise, nice app - best way I've found to communicate with friends and family!"},{"topic": "Great option to carrier text!", "rating": 5, "version": "Version 2.11.12", "user": "What's that mean", "text": "Especially when out of the country"},{"topic": "for iPhone 6 Plus", "rating": 4, "version": "Version 2.11.12", "user": "Joe Nemnom", "text": "Keep the iPhone 6 Plus users in mind here.

Viber and bbm and iMessage and most others tell you when your message has been read (vital) not just when its been delivered. And, I can't believe I'm going to say this, but stickers are a fun and easy way to elevate messaging. I mean, who doesn't smile at legcat? Whatsapp doesn't have that. It's dull. And quite a few messaging apps allow you to place free wifi calls within the app, also a great touch. There are many other minor touches within the other apps that you would hope whatsapp would have integrated, but they haven't. It's maddening. So, now I'll only use it when I have no choice but it's already been relegated to a subfolder on my phone. Too bad.

I have no idea on what hapenned, but it just happens that I often tap on \"SEND\", the button shows the \"tap\" (it glows or whatever), but no action happens, so I have to tap it again, more precisely, harder, etc.\nSecondly, I entered an infinite loop of connection attempt, while I clearly had a good and fully working wifi connection. It kept trying to connect, but never actually did (tbh waited just like 2 minutes). Also, while on Conversations tab, and while on this \"infinite connection attempt\" state, when I tried to open Settings tab, it lagged the view for about 5 seconds until it finally appeared.\nFor now, that's all.

The application does not crowd the user with features, \"choices\" or commands - it is a streamlined tool. - Nor does it bury features under a veneer of clean graphic design that sometimes gets called UI. No - it is quite good and capable. And the graphic design is good too. The use of system scaled typography is a great choice. \n\nOne of the best things is the task orientation of commands, being able to either create or pull photos or audio or location without digging behind the standard tap and hold UI widget. When you are on the go or any time - flattening the command levels like this is efficient and excellent. \n\nThere are several places the UI could be improved - but I'll stick to one for this review because this is the one that throws interference into my muscle memory most often: \n\nStandard touch gesture for keyboard hiding in iOS 7 is a swipe down. What's App uses a tap on the content to hide the keyboard. This should be changed for two reasons:\n\n1 - The tap to hide is easier to accidentally trigger - and accidental trigger is the worst from of gesture discovery. \n\n2 - Swipe down is the current standard and tap to hide works against any consistent habits the users have built up regarding KB hiding gestures."},{"topic": "Game changer", "rating": 5, "version": "Version 2.11.8", "user": "J-J-Mello", "text": "This app allows me to communicate with my sister and bro-in-law all the way over in Hungary!

The fundamental of the app does not have to change. Only some small tweaks that I'd suggest to make this app the best all  around app for communications on mobile devices. \n1. The ticks at he right of the message once I sent it, I would hope that it would have another way to indicate that the recipient of the message had actually read the message. It is very useful when I'm trying to know if my friend has read my messages or not, like that I would know if he's on silent mode, then I would send them another message another time or just wait since I understand that they are busy at the moment. \n2. Then comes a suggestion that I would like to implement, even if this functions requires a premium fee, I would highly consider it. Sending media at full resolution without compression, this could possibly remove the need for iMessage since most of my friend would come from different platforms. Implementing this options of course comes with option to send uncompressed media only through wifi and not mobile data. \nThanks for doing a great job."},{"topic": "best app ever", "rating": 5, "version": "Version 2.11.8", "user": "Ayoo'Mariee <3", "text": "it's a good app to text . but they need it on ipod too ! \ud83d\ude29"},{"topic": "Just great!", "rating": 5, "version": "Version 2.11.8", "user": "pilot747400er", "text": "WhatsApp has really changed the way I communicate with my family and friends!

For example,when talking to Friend A in English I want to only speak English to Friend A. And to Friend B en espa\u00f1ol, solamente. Friend C in let's say, Thai. So my request is, please make it so the keyboard doesn't change within the application. It would be super helpful because as is when talking to Friend A in English my keyboard for Friend B changes to English also. I would love it if in the next update, the keyboard remained the same for the language being spoken in that specific conversation.\n\nI hope this makes sense....
